# Financial-Tracker
Personal financial tracker using Excel and VBA
<br><br>

<h2>Dashboard</h2>
Using Excel VBA and a financial event logger, the user is prompted to enter their financial events (credit payments, deposits, etc), which allows the tracking of many benchmarks. These include cash flow, disposible income, and more.

<h2>Investment</h2>
Using CoinGecko's crypto API and the built in stock tool, I am able to track the status of all of my investments live despite the fact that they are through different brokers.
